          <h5>Round 2 : (HOT SEAT ROUND)</h5>After determining the winner of Fastest Fingers First, they would join the host in the ""Hot Seat"" to start answering a series of multiple-choice questions on their way to win the top cash prize . Along
          the way, the contestant is free to walk away from the game with their winnings but if they get a question wrong, they would walk away with nothing unless they correctly answered a milestone question that would guarantee some winnings.
          To help them along the way, much like its counterparts, the contestants have a set of lifelines available for them to use.
          <br> â¢ Audience Poll (Ask the Audience): The remaining contestants who didnât gain the opportunity of a hot seat during the first time are considered to be the audience here. They can vote for a specific option which they feel the
          most appropriate and the results of the poll are shown to the hot seat contestant.<br> â¢ 50:50: Two wrong answers from the game would be removed leaving the player one right and one wrong answer.
          <br> â¢ Phone-A-Friend: The contestant could call a pre-selected friend or family member of their choosing (the participants would be requested in prior to give the contact details of the pre-selected friends or family members during
          registration) to aid them in answering the question. Once connected, the aiding party and the contestant have 30 seconds to talk it out among themselves."
